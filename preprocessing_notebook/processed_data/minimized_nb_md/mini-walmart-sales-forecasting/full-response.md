I'll analyze this markdown file to identify the most important quantitative conclusion and determine which code blocks are essential for reproducing it.

## 1. Most Important Quantitative Conclusion

The most important quantitative conclusion is the final WMAE (Weighted Mean Absolute Error) score of 840.681060966696 achieved using the ExponentialSmoothing model on the differenced weekly sales data. This represents the best predictive performance for forecasting Walmart's weekly sales.

## 2. Analysis of Code Blocks

### Essential Components:

1. **Data Loading and Import**:
   - Loading the three datasets (stores.csv, train.csv, features.csv)
   - Merging these datasets into a single dataframe

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Removing duplicate columns
   - Renaming columns
   - Removing rows with negative or zero weekly sales
   - Converting date to datetime format
   - Creating new time-based features (week, month, year)
   - Creating holiday-specific columns

3. **Time Series Preparation**:
   - Setting date as index
   - Resampling data to weekly averages
   - Creating differenced data to achieve stationarity

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Train-test splitting of the differenced data
   - Building the ExponentialSmoothing model
   - Forecasting and calculating the WMAE

### Non-Essential Components:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizations of sales patterns
   - Correlation analysis
   - Feature importance analysis

2. **Alternative Models**:
   - Random Forest Regressor attempts
   - Auto-ARIMA model

3. **Visualization Code**:
   - Plotting of predictions, seasonal decompositions, etc.

# Background

Walmart is a renowned retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets. Here, Walmart has provided a data combining of 45 stores including store information and monthly sales. The data is provided on weekly basis. Walmart tries to find the impact of holidays on the sales of store. For which it has included four holidays' weeks into the dataset which are Christmas, Thanksgiving, Super bowl, Labor Day. Here we are owing to Analyze the dataset given. Before doing that, let me point out the objective of this analysis. 

# Business Objectives

Our Main Objective is to predict sales of store in a week. As in dataset size and time related data are given as feature, so analyze if sales are impacted by time-based factors and space- based factor. Most importantly how inclusion of holidays in a week soars the sales in store?

   - Random Forest Regressor attempts
   - Auto-ARIMA model
   - Feature importance analysis
