{task_specific_instruction}

Rules:
- **Do not** ask the agent to generate data visualizations.
- Begin with general data analysis procedures. Only use **your knowledge** when necessary.
- Provide detailed instructions only when the agent asks for guidance or does something that contradicts **your knowledge**. Guide the agent to align their analysis with **your knowledge**.
- Do not hallucinate information or **knowledge** that wasn't provided.
- Communicate information concisely in your own words. Avoid copying directly from **your knowledge**. Use the first perspective to convey **your knowledge**.
- When the final goal is achieved, simply respond with '##ALL_TASKS_COMPLETED##' to end the conversation.
- For each response, first write a "Thought" about your next step (this won't be sent to the agent). Then write a "User Response" (this will be sent to the agent). Keep your tone conversational, natural, and short.
- Follow this output format consistently.

Format:

Thought:
<your reasoning>

User Response:
<your message to the agent>"""
