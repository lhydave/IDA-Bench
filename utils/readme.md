# filter.py

A simple Python script that filters out redundant information from a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`), retaining only:

- The `"source"` of both Markdown and Code cells
- The `"output:text/plain"` from Code cells

This is useful for simplifying notebook files, e.g., for version control or clean exports.
