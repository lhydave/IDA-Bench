      "- Handle missing values differently by data type: use median for numerical features and mode for categorical features to avoid skew from extreme values.\n",
      "- Create a 'capacity_per_compartment' feature as the ratio of weight capacity to number of compartments, which serves as an important predictor.\n",
      "- Remove the 'is_premium' feature as it may cause data leakage by being too closely related to the target variable (Price).\n",
      "- Use one-hot encoding with drop_first=True for categorical variables to avoid the dummy variable trap and multicollinearity issues.\n",
      "- Standardize features before model training, which benefits tree-based models when features have different scales.\n",
      "- Tree-based ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) perform well, suggesting non-linear relationships between features and price.\n",
      "- Consider creating a 'price_range' categorical feature from the continuous 'Price' variable for interpretability in analysis.\n",
      "- Evaluate models using multiple metrics (RMSE, R², MAE) rather than optimizing for a single metric to get comprehensive performance information.\n",

      "- Handle missing oil prices using forward and backward fill methods to maintain temporal continuity rather than statistical measures.\n",
      "- Create lag features (7 and 14 days) to capture weekly seasonality patterns in sales.\n",
      "- Shift rolling averages by 1 day to avoid data leakage, ensuring features only use information that would be available at prediction time.\n",
      "- Calculate promotion ratio (promotional items/transactions) rather than using raw promotion counts.\n",
      "- Only use actual celebration dates of holidays rather than official dates when holidays are transferred.\n",
      "- Validate models using the last 90 days of training data to respect the temporal nature of the problem.\n",
      "- Ensure predictions are non-negative since negative sales values are impossible.\n",
      "- Treat store number and product family as categorical features rather than numerical ones.\n",
      "- Use early stopping with sufficient patience (100 rounds) to balance learning complex patterns with preventing overfitting.\n",
