<description>
This code imports the essential libraries required for the Titanic survival prediction project. Import numpy as np for numerical operations, pandas as pd for data manipulation, and from scikit-learn import the train_test_split and GridSearchCV functions for data splitting and hyperparameter tuning respectively. Additionally, import LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing to convert categorical variables into numerical format, and RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble which will serve as the machine learning algorithm for this classification task. These libraries provide the necessary tools for data handling, preprocessing, and implementing the machine learning pipeline for the Titanic dataset analysis.

# Load Titanic dataset
train_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv')

# Create copies to avoid SettingWithCopyWarning
train_df = train_df.copy()
test_df = test_df.copy()
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This code block performs two main operations:
1. Data Loading:
   - Loads the Titanic dataset from CSV files in a Kaggle environment
   - train_df loads the training data with target variable (Survived)
   - test_df loads the test data without the target variable

2. DataFrame Copying:
   - Creates explicit copies of both DataFrames
   - This is done to avoid the SettingWithCopyWarning in pandas that can occur when modifying views vs. copies
   - Ensures that subsequent modifications are made to independent DataFrame copies rather than views

The paths indicate this is being run in a Kaggle notebook environment where the Titanic dataset is available at the specified location.
</code_analysis>

<description>
This code loads the Titanic dataset from the Kaggle environment and creates safe copies for manipulation. First, read the training and testing datasets using pd.read_csv() from their respective paths '/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv' and '/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv', storing them in train_df and test_df variables. Then, create explicit copies of both DataFrames using the copy() method to prevent potential SettingWithCopyWarning issues that might occur during subsequent data modifications. This ensures that all future operations will be performed on independent DataFrame copies rather than views, which is a best practice when performing multiple transformations on pandas DataFrames.

# ---- Step 2: Data Preprocessing (Fully Fixed) ----
# Fill missing Age values based on Pclass median
train_df.loc[:, "Age"] = train_df.groupby("Pclass")["Age"].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))
test_df.loc[:, "Age"] = test_df.groupby("Pclass")["Age"].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))

# Extract first letter of Cabin as a new feature
train_df.loc[:, "CabinLetter"] = train_df["Cabin"].str[0].fillna("X")  # X = no cabin info
test_df.loc[:, "CabinLetter"] = test_df["Cabin"].str[0].fillna("X")

# Fill missing Embarked values with the most common value (Fixed Warning)
train_df.loc[:, "Embarked"] = train_df["Embarked"].fillna(train_df["Embarked"].mode()[0])
test_df.loc[:, "Embarked"] = test_df["Embarked"].fillna(test_df["Embarked"].mode()[0])

# Fill missing Fare values based on Pclass median
test_df.loc[:, "Fare"] = test_df.groupby("Pclass")["Fare"].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))

# Create a new feature: FamilySize
train_df.loc[:, "FamilySize"] = train_df["SibSp"] + train_df["Parch"] + 1
test_df.loc[:, "FamilySize"] = test_df["SibSp"] + test_df["Parch"] + 1

test_df.loc[:, "IsAlone"] = (test_df["FamilySize"] == 1).astype(int)
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This code block performs several data preprocessing steps:

1. Missing Value Imputation:
   - Age: Fills missing values with the median age for each passenger class (Pclass)
   - Cabin: Creates a new feature "CabinLetter" by extracting the first letter of the cabin and fills missing values with "X"
   - Embarked: Fills missing values with the most common (mode) embarked port
   - Fare: Fills missing fare values in the test set with the median fare for each passenger class

2. Feature Engineering:
   - CabinLetter: Extracts the first character of the Cabin value as a new feature
   - FamilySize: Creates a new feature by adding SibSp (siblings/spouses), Parch (parents/children), and 1 (the passenger themselves)
   - IsAlone: Creates a binary feature indicating whether a passenger is traveling alone (1) or with family (0)

The code uses the .loc accessor to avoid pandas warnings and ensure proper assignment. The transform method is used with groupby to maintain the DataFrame's original structure while applying the imputation.
</code_analysis>

<description>
This code block handles missing values and creates new features in both training and test datasets. For missing Age values, the code imputes them with the median age of the corresponding passenger class (Pclass) using groupby and transform with a lambda function. It then creates a new feature "CabinLetter" by extracting the first letter of each Cabin value and replacing missing values with "X". Missing Embarked values are filled with the most frequent value (mode) from the training set, while missing Fare values in the test set are imputed with the median fare of the corresponding passenger class. The code also engineers two new features: "FamilySize" by summing the number of siblings/spouses (SibSp), parents/children (Parch), and adding 1 for the passenger themselves; and "IsAlone", a binary indicator set to 1 if FamilySize equals 1 and 0 otherwise, converted to integer type. All operations use the .loc accessor to avoid pandas warnings during assignment.

# Convert categorical variables to numerical

train_df.loc[:, "Embarked"] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df["Embarked"])
test_df.loc[:, "Embarked"] = label_encoder.transform(test_df["Embarked"])

train_df.loc[:, "CabinLetter"] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_df["CabinLetter"])
test_df.loc[:, "CabinLetter"] = label_encoder.transform(test_df["CabinLetter"])

test_df.drop(columns=["Name", "Ticket", "Cabin"], inplace=True)
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This code block performs two main operations:

1. Categorical Variable Encoding:
   - Creates a LabelEncoder object to convert categorical variables to numerical values
   - For each categorical feature (Sex, Embarked, CabinLetter):
     - Fits and transforms the training data using fit_transform()
     - Only transforms the test data using transform() to ensure consistent encoding
   - This approach ensures that the same encoding scheme is applied to both training and test sets
   - The .loc accessor is used for proper assignment to avoid pandas warnings

2. Feature Removal:
   - Drops columns that are deemed unnecessary for the model: "Name", "Ticket", and "Cabin"
   - The original "Cabin" column is removed since its information has been extracted into "CabinLetter"
   - Uses inplace=True to modify the DataFrames directly without creating new copies

The pattern of fit_transform on training data and transform on test data is important to prevent data leakage while ensuring consistent encoding across datasets.
</code_analysis>

<description>
This code converts categorical variables to numerical format and removes unnecessary columns from both datasets. First, instantiate a LabelEncoder object, then apply it to the categorical features "Sex", "Embarked", and "CabinLetter". For each feature, use fit_transform() on the training data to learn the encoding and apply it, then use transform() on the test data to ensure consistent encoding across both datasets. This approach prevents data leakage while maintaining the same encoding scheme. The code uses the .loc accessor for proper DataFrame assignment to avoid pandas warnings. After encoding, remove the unnecessary columns "Name", "Ticket", and "Cabin" from both datasets using the drop() method with inplace=True, as these features are either redundant (Cabin information is now in CabinLetter) or not useful for the model in their raw form.

# Define features and target variable
features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Embarked", "CabinLetter", "FamilySize", "IsAlone"]
X = train_df[features]
y = train_df["Survived"]

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This code block performs two key operations for preparing the data for model training:

1. Feature and Target Definition:
   - Creates a list of feature names to be used in the model
   - The features include original features (Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked) and engineered features (CabinLetter, FamilySize, IsAlone)
   - Extracts these features from train_df into X
   - Extracts the target variable "Survived" from train_df into y

2. Train-Validation Split:
   - Uses train_test_split from scikit-learn to split the data
   - Allocates 80% of the data for training (X_train, y_train) and 20% for validation (X_val, y_val)
   - Sets random_state=42 for reproducibility of the split
   - This split creates a validation set to evaluate model performance before final testing

This step prepares the data for model training and validation, separating the features from the target and creating appropriate subsets for training and evaluation.
</code_analysis>

<description>
This code prepares the data for model training by defining the feature set and target variable, then splitting them into training and validation sets. First, create a list named 'features' containing all the predictor variables to be used in the model, including both original features (Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked) and the engineered features (CabinLetter, FamilySize, IsAlone). Then, extract these features from the training DataFrame into variable X, and extract the target variable "Survived" into variable y. Next, use the train_test_split function to divide the data into training and validation sets, with 20% of the data allocated for validation (test_size=0.2) and the remainder for training. Set random_state=42 to ensure reproducibility of the split, resulting in four datasets: X_train and y_train for model training, and X_val and y_val for model validation before final testing.

# ---- Step 3: Model Training (Improved) ----
# Tune Random Forest hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2]
}

rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(rf, param_grid, cv=5, scoring="accuracy")
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best model
best_rf = grid_search.best_estimator_
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This code block performs hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest classifier:

1. Hyperparameter Grid Definition:
   - Creates a dictionary 'param_grid' with hyperparameters to tune:
     - n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest [100, 200]
     - max_depth: Maximum depth of trees [None (unlimited), 5, 10]
     - min_samples_split: Minimum samples required to split a node [2, 5]
     - min_samples_leaf: Minimum samples required at a leaf node [1, 2]
   - This creates 2×3×2×2 = 24 different model configurations to evaluate

2. Model Setup and Grid Search:
   - Initializes a RandomForestClassifier with random_state=42 for reproducibility
   - Creates a GridSearchCV object that will:
     - Try all combinations of hyperparameters in param_grid
     - Use 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5)
     - Evaluate models based on accuracy (scoring="accuracy")
   - Fits the grid search on the training data (X_train, y_train)

3. Best Model Selection:
   - Extracts the best performing model from the grid search results
   - Stores it in best_rf for later use in prediction

This approach systematically explores the hyperparameter space to find the optimal Random Forest configuration for the Titanic survival prediction task.
</code_analysis>

<description>
This code performs hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest classifier using GridSearchCV to find the optimal model configuration. First, define a parameter grid dictionary containing the hyperparameters to tune: number of trees (n_estimators) with values 100 and 200, maximum tree depth (max_depth) with values None, 5, and 10, minimum samples required to split a node (min_samples_split) with values 2 and 5, and minimum samples required at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf) with values 1 and 2. Next, initialize a RandomForestClassifier with random_state=42 for reproducibility, then create a GridSearchCV object that will evaluate all 24 possible hyperparameter combinations using 5-fold cross-validation (cv=5) with accuracy as the evaluation metric. Fit this grid search on the training data (X_train, y_train), which automatically trains and evaluates all model configurations. Finally, extract the best performing model configuration from the grid search results using the best_estimator_ attribute and store it in the variable best_rf for subsequent prediction.

# ---- Step 4: Generate Predictions for Submission ----
X_test = test_df[features]
predictions = best_rf.predict(X_test)

# Create submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({"PassengerId": test_df["PassengerId"], "Survived": predictions})
submission.to_csv("submission.csv", index=False)
</code_block>

<code_analysis>
This final code block handles the prediction and submission process:

1. Test Data Preparation:
   - Extracts the same features from the test dataset that were used for training
   - Creates X_test using the previously defined 'features' list to ensure consistency

2. Prediction Generation:
   - Uses the best Random Forest model (best_rf) from the grid search
   - Applies the predict method to generate survival predictions for the test data

3. Submission File
